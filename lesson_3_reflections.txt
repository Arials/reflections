When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Always, i guess

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because some changes are minor updates that you need to do, but until you make a lot of them, the project doesn't work, so until the project can work, you don't want to push them.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork - for copy a repository to my GitHub account.
Clone - for clone a repository in my GitHub account to my local machine,
Branches - when i need to try something new in parallel with the master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
If you are going to be offline and in the moment you don't want to do a commit, you can save this state to make a manual commit when you consider.
