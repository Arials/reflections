When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Always, i guess

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because some changes are minor updates that you need to do, but until you make a lot of them, the project doesn't work, so until the project can work, you don't want to push them.
